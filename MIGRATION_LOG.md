## Chronological Log Entries

### [2025-10-25 16:08] - Phase 1: Create AI_AGENT_INDEX.md
**Agent**: AI Agent (Initial Setup)  
**Status**: Completed  

**Changes Made**:
- Created `AI_AGENT_INDEX.md` as the master documentation index for all AI agents
- Structured with navigation map, current status dashboard, critical file paths, tech stack overview
- Added AI agent workflow sequence and MCP reference repositories
- Included document update protocol and next steps guidance
- Used consistent markdown formatting with emojis for visual scanning

**Files Affected**:
- `AI_AGENT_INDEX.md` (NEW)

**Issues Encountered**: None

**Next Steps**:
- Continue with Phase 1 documentation setup
- Create `MIGRATION_LOG.md` (this file)
- Create remaining 4 new documentation files
- Update 7 existing documentation files with reference sections

### [2025-10-25 19:01] - Phase 2: Configure MCP Servers and Clean Up MCP Policy
**Agent**: AI Agent (MCP Configuration)  
**Status**: Completed  

**Changes Made**:
- Simplified `cline_mcp_settings.json` from 18 servers to 6 essential servers (67% reduction)
- Removed complex nested GitHub-specific properties (defaultBranch, readOnly, allowedPaths, chunkPolicy, auth, webhooks)
- Updated to clean JSON structure with only `url`, `disabled`, and `autoApprove` properties
- Added Convex-relevant MCP servers: Convex Backend Docs, BetterAuth Docs, XState Docs, Shadcn UI Docs, Tailwind CSS Docs, Next.js Docs, HeroUI Docs
- Removed 12 unused servers: Prisma, Encore, NextAuth, Axios, React Hook Form, dnd-kit, Recharts, Sharp, date-fns, react-use, framer-motion, next-themes
- Updated `MCP_POLICY.md` component mappings to reference only migration-relevant technologies
- Removed YAML frontmatter from `MCP_POLICY.md` (lines 1-27) - unnecessary for MCP consumption
- Added ADR-007 to `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` documenting MCP configuration simplification decision
- Updated Technology Stack Summary table in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` to include MCP Servers row (18‚Üí6 reduction)
- Copied updated MCP configuration to global Cline settings for persistence

**Files Affected**:
- `cline_mcp_settings.json` (MODIFY) - Complete replacement with simplified 6-server configuration
- `MCP_POLICY.md` (MODIFY) - Removed YAML frontmatter, updated component mappings
- `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` (MODIFY) - Added ADR-007, updated Technology Stack Summary
- `/home/user/.codeoss-cloudworkstations/data/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` (MODIFY) - Global MCP settings updated with 7 servers

**Issues Encountered**: None

**Root Cause**: Original MCP configuration was over-engineered for consumption rather than exposure, with many unused technology references that would slow down AI agent initialization

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 1 documentation setup is now complete
- MCP servers are now focused on migration-relevant technologies
- Ready to proceed with Phase 3: Initialize Convex Project
- All MCP configuration is now optimized and synchronized across locations

### [2025-10-26 14:08] - Phase 4: Simplified Auth Implementation
**Agent**: AI Agent  
**Status**: Completed  

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced complex BetterAuth integration with simplified Convex built-in auth approach
- Updated `convex/auth.ts` with simple auth helpers using `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`
- Simplified `convex/http.ts` to basic HTTP router (removed BetterAuth routes)
- Maintained auth middleware functions: `getCurrentUser`, `requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`
- Successfully resolved all TypeScript compilation errors
- Convex dev server running: "Convex functions ready!" with ZERO errors

**Issues Encountered**:
- BetterAuth integration was overly complex for Phase 4 requirements
- Multiple TypeScript errors due to incorrect BetterAuth API usage
- Convex backend process conflicts during restart attempts
- Resolved by following anti-spiral rule: use simple, proven solution

**Resolution**:
- Applied simplified Convex built-in auth pattern (following user guidance)

## Agent Handoff Notes

**Last Agent**: GLM 4.6  
**Last Task Completed**: Phase 3 - Initialize Convex Project  
**Current State**: Phases 1-3 are complete (30%). Convex infrastructure is fully operational with all 13 database tables defined, 25+ performance indexes created, and schema following Convex best practices. MCP compliance maintained throughout.
