## Architecture Overview

### Backend Services (Encore.ts)

1. **auth** - Authentication and authorization
   - Bearer token validation
   - Role enforcement (Admin/Staff)
   - Org-scoped access control

2. **fleet** - Ships and services management
   - Ships CRUD with status tracking
   - Services catalog with pricing types
   - Draft/Published workflow

3. **quotes** - Quote calculation engine
   - Pricing rules with priority execution
   - Live calculation with breakdown
   - Immutable quote snapshots

4. **bookings** - Reservation management
   - Quick-book with availability checks
   - Conflict detection (409 responses)
   - Maintenance window enforcement

5. **conversations** - Unified messaging inbox
   - Multi-platform thread support
   - Inbound webhook mapping
   - Send/receive flows

6. **files** - File upload and storage
   - Signed upload/download URLs
   - Object storage integration
   - Primary image designation

7. **settings** - Organization configuration
   - Feature toggles
   - AI provider management
   - Admin-only access

8. **ai** - AI assistant
   - Single-context queries
   - Usage tracking and limits
   - Confidence scoring

### Frontend Components (React + TypeScript)

- **QuotesView** - Quote generator with live calculator
- **ConversationsView** - Thread list and messaging UI
- **BookingsView** - Calendar with per-ship bars
- **FleetView** - Ship management with status editor
- **SettingsAdminView** - Org settings and toggles
- **AIAssistantWidget** - Floating assistant bubble

### Database Schema

**13 new tables** created in migration `2_extended_schema.up.sql`:
- users, ships, services, pricing_rules
- quotes, bookings
- threads, thread_messages
- settings, files
- audit_logs, ai_providers, ai_usage

**Preserved existing tables**:
- leads, messages

## Key Implementation Details

### Quote Calculation Logic

```typescript
shipCharge = hourlyRate Ã— hours
per_hour_service = unitPrice Ã— quantity Ã— hours
per_person_service = unitPrice Ã— quantity Ã— people
flat_service = unitPrice Ã— quantity

+ pricing rules applied by priority
= subtotal + tax = total
```

### Booking Availability Checks

1. Ship status validation (not maintenance/offline)
2. Scheduled maintenance window check
3. Time overlap conflict detection
4. Alternative ship suggestions on 409

### File Upload Flow

1. Frontend requests signed upload URL
2. Backend generates URL with 1-hour TTL
3. Frontend uploads directly to bucket
4. Metadata stored in DB with owner reference

### AI Assistant Flow

1. Check org toggle enabled
2. Validate user monthly quota (100 queries)
3. Fetch single-context data (bounded)
4. Call AI provider (simulated, ready for OpenAI)
5. Log usage and return answer with sources

## Security Implementation

### Secrets Management
- `UNIPILE_TOKEN` and `OpenAIToken` configured in Leap Infrastructure
- No raw secrets in codebase (placeholders only)
- Runtime injection via secret manager
- Emergency kill-switch documented in RUNBOOK.md

### Authentication & Authorization
- Bearer token on all protected endpoints
- Org-scoped data isolation
- Admin-only operations enforced server-side
- Active user status validation

### PII Redaction
- Secrets redacted from logs
- PII not logged in AI queries
- Audit logs track sensitive actions

## Visual Design

### Status Color Scheme
- Available: Green (#10b981)
- Booked: Red (#ef4444)
- Maintenance: Orange (#f97316)
- Offline: Gray (#6b7280)
- Reserved: Blue (#3b82f6)

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: 375px
- Tablet: 768px
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Navigation Structure
Left sidebar with:
- Dashboard
- Conversations
- Quotes
- Bookings
- Fleet
- Leads
