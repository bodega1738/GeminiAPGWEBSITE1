I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The Maritime CRM project currently has 8 separate documentation files scattered across the root directory. The user wants to create a unified, AI-agent-optimized documentation structure that will guide future LLM agents through the Encore ‚Üí Convex migration. The existing docs include setup instructions (`DEVELOPMENT.md`), operations guide (`RUNBOOK.md`), code audit (`COMPREHENSIVE_CODE_AUDIT.md`), implementation summary (`IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`), API reference (`API-DOCUMENTATION.md`), version history (`CHANGELOG.md`), and MCP policy (`MCP_POLICY.md`). The codebase uses Encore.dev backend with PostgreSQL, Vite + React frontend, and includes 9 backend services (auth, bookings, conversations, crm, fleet, quotes, files, ai, settings) with 13 database tables.

### Approach

Create a master documentation index (`AI_AGENT_INDEX.md`) that serves as the single entry point for all AI agents, with clear navigation to all existing and new documentation. Add 5 new specialized documentation files optimized for AI consumption: `MIGRATION_LOG.md` for tracking real-time migration progress, `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` for documenting why Convex/XState/BetterAuth were chosen, `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` for cataloging all components and their purposes, `ERROR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` for common issues and solutions, and `AI_DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md` for step-by-step implementation guides. Update all existing documentation files to include a reference section at the top pointing back to the master index. Structure all content with clear headings, consistent formatting, and AI-friendly patterns (explicit file paths, clear decision rationales, actionable guidance).

### Reasoning

Listed the repository structure to understand the file organization, then read all 7 existing documentation files to understand their current content and structure. Reviewed sample backend code (`backend/crm/leads.ts`, `backend/fleet/ships.ts`) and frontend code (`frontend/components/Dashboard.tsx`) to understand the current Encore.dev patterns that will be migrated to Convex. This gave me a complete picture of what needs to be documented for AI agents to successfully execute the migration.

## Proposed File Changes

### ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md(NEW)

Create an Architecture Decision Records (ADR) document that explains the rationale behind choosing Convex, XState, and BetterAuth. Structure it with the following sections:

1. **Document Purpose** - Explain that this document captures all major architectural decisions made during the Encore ‚Üí Convex migration, following the ADR pattern to help future developers and AI agents understand the "why" behind technical choices.

2. **ADR-001: Migration from Encore.dev to Convex**
   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Context**: The current backend uses Encore.dev with PostgreSQL. The user wants to migrate to Convex for "local convenient AI driven development" with better real-time capabilities and simpler local setup.
   - **Decision**: Migrate entire backend from Encore.dev to Convex
   - **Rationale**:
     - Convex provides built-in real-time subscriptions without additional infrastructure
     - Simpler local development (no PostgreSQL, no Encore CLI)
     - Better TypeScript integration with end-to-end type safety
     - Easier for AI coding assistants to understand (simpler patterns than Encore's `api()` decorator)
     - Document-relational database model is more flexible for rapid iteration
     - Serverless architecture reduces operational complexity
   - **Consequences**:
     - Positive: Real-time by default, simpler setup, better DX, automatic API generation
     - Negative: Loss of SQL flexibility, need to rewrite all queries, cannot use PostgreSQL extensions
     - Neutral: Different mental model (document vs relational), learning curve for team
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Keep Encore.dev: Rejected due to complex local setup and difficulty for AI assistants
     - Migrate to Next.js API routes + Prisma: Rejected due to lack of real-time features
     - Migrate to Supabase: Rejected due to user preference for Convex

3. **ADR-002: State Management with XState**
   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Context**: The application has complex workflows (booking conflicts, quote generation, AI assistant conversations) that need explicit state management. Currently no state machine library is used.
   - **Decision**: Integrate XState for complex workflow state machines
   - **Rationale**:
     - Explicit state machines make complex workflows easier to understand and debug
     - Visual state charts can be generated for documentation
     - Prevents impossible states and invalid transitions
     - Better for AI agents to reason about workflow logic
     - Integrates well with Convex mutations for state persistence
   - **Consequences**:
     - Positive: Clearer workflow logic, easier debugging, better documentation, prevents bugs
     - Negative: Learning curve, additional dependency, more boilerplate for simple flows
     - Neutral: Need to identify which workflows benefit from state machines
   - **Workflows Using XState**:
     - Booking Flow: availability check ‚Üí conflict resolution ‚Üí confirmation
     - Quote Generation: configure ‚Üí calculate ‚Üí save ‚Üí convert to booking
     - AI Assistant: conversation state ‚Üí rate limiting ‚Üí response generation
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - No state management: Rejected due to complexity of workflows
     - Redux: Rejected as overkill for this use case
     - Zustand: Rejected as it doesn't provide state machine guarantees

4. **ADR-003: Authentication with BetterAuth**
   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Context**: Current auth uses Encore's `authHandler` with custom token validation. Need to replace with Convex-compatible auth solution.
   - **Decision**: Use BetterAuth for authentication
   - **Rationale**:
     - Modern, TypeScript-first auth library
     - Integrates well with Convex
     - Supports multiple providers (email, OAuth, etc.)
     - Better developer experience than NextAuth.js
     - Simpler configuration than Auth0 or Clerk
     - User explicitly requested BetterAuth in MCP configuration
   - **Consequences**:
     - Positive: Modern auth patterns, good TypeScript support, flexible providers
     - Negative: Newer library (less mature than NextAuth), smaller community
     - Neutral: Need to migrate existing user records and sessions
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - NextAuth.js: Rejected due to complexity and user preference
     - Clerk: Rejected due to cost and external dependency
     - Auth0: Rejected due to complexity and cost
     - Custom JWT: Rejected due to security concerns and maintenance burden

5. **ADR-004: Frontend Framework Decision**
   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Context**: Current frontend uses Vite + React. User asked if frontend migration is necessary.
   - **Decision**: Keep Vite + React, do NOT migrate to Next.js
   - **Rationale**:
     - User confirmed: "If it works completely fine with no hiccups If I paired with convex, it is not an issue"
     - Convex works perfectly with Vite + React via `convex/react` package
     - Minimizes migration scope (focus on backend)
     - Avoids unnecessary complexity
     - Current frontend architecture is solid (React 19, TanStack Query, Tailwind)
   - **Consequences**:
     - Positive: Smaller migration scope, less risk, faster completion
     - Negative: No SSR/SSG benefits, no Next.js optimizations
     - Neutral: Can migrate to Next.js later if needed
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Migrate to Next.js: Rejected as unnecessary for current requirements

6. **ADR-005: Database Schema Migration Strategy**
   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Context**: Current PostgreSQL schema has 13 tables with complex relationships. User has no production data ("just barely functioning features").
   - **Decision**: Fresh start with Convex schema, no data migration
   - **Rationale**:
     - No production data to preserve
     - Opportunity to optimize schema for Convex's document model
     - Simpler than trying to migrate PostgreSQL data
     - Can redesign relationships for better performance
   - **Consequences**:
     - Positive: Clean slate, optimized schema, no migration complexity
     - Negative: Lose any test data (acceptable per user)
     - Neutral: Need to carefully design new schema

7. **ADR-006: Migration Approach (Big Bang vs Incremental)**
   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Context**: User chose "Option A: Big bang migrate everything at once" but noted "I am certain it will not certainly take 2 weeks"
   - **Decision**: Big bang migration with realistic timeline (4-6 weeks)
   - **Rationale**:
     - User preference for complete migration
     - No production system to maintain during migration
     - Simpler than running two backends in parallel
     - AI agent can handle entire migration autonomously
   - **Consequences**:
     - Positive: Clean cutover, no dual maintenance, simpler deployment
     - Negative: Higher risk, longer downtime, all-or-nothing
     - Neutral: Need comprehensive testing before launch

8. **Technology Stack Summary** - Quick reference table:
   - Backend Framework: Encore.dev ‚Üí Convex
   - Database: PostgreSQL ‚Üí Convex (document-relational)
   - Auth: Encore authHandler ‚Üí BetterAuth
   - State Management: None ‚Üí XState (selective)
   - Frontend: Vite + React (no change)
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui (no change)
   - Data Fetching: TanStack Query ‚Üí Convex hooks (useQuery, useMutation)

9. **Future Considerations** - Decisions deferred:
   - Next.js migration: Revisit if SSR/SEO becomes important
   - XState usage: Start with 3 workflows, expand if beneficial
   - Testing strategy: TBD during implementation
   - Deployment platform: Convex Cloud (default)

Use clear ADR format with Status, Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences, and Alternatives for each decision. Reference specific user requirements from the consultation (Q1-Q14 answers).

   ```

4. **Pre-populated Common Errors** - Based on the code audit and anticipated migration issues:

   **ERROR-001: Encore API Decorator Not Found**
   - Category: Migration
   - Severity: High
   - Error: `Cannot find name 'api' from 'encore.dev/api'`
   - Context: Trying to use Encore patterns in Convex
   - Root Cause: Encore's `api()` decorator doesn't exist in Convex
   - Solution: Replace with Convex `query()` or `mutation()` from `convex/server`
   - Prevention: Always import from `convex/server`, not `encore.dev/api`

   **ERROR-002: PostgreSQL Query Syntax in Convex**
   - Category: Migration
   - Severity: High
   - Error: `db.queryAll is not a function`
   - Context: Trying to use Encore's database client in Convex
   - Root Cause: Convex uses `ctx.db.query()` instead of SQL queries
   - Solution: Replace SQL queries with Convex query API (e.g., `ctx.db.query('leads').collect()`)
   - Prevention: Review Convex query patterns before migrating database code

   **ERROR-003: Auth Middleware Not Applied**
   - Category: BetterAuth
   - Severity: Critical
   - Error: `Unauthorized access - no auth data found`
   - Context: Protected Convex function not checking auth
   - Root Cause: Forgot to add auth check in Convex function
   - Solution: Add `const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity(); if (!identity) throw new Error('Unauthorized');`
   - Prevention: Always check auth in protected functions, use helper function

   **ERROR-004: XState Machine Not Persisting State**
   - Category: XState
   - Severity: Medium
   - Error: State machine resets on page refresh
   - Context: XState machine state not saved to Convex
   - Root Cause: State only exists in memory, not persisted
   - Solution: Save machine state to Convex table, restore on initialization
   - Prevention: Always persist state machines that need to survive page refreshes

   **ERROR-005: Convex Function Timeout**
   - Category: Convex
   - Severity: High
   - Error: `Function execution timed out after 60s`
   - Context: Long-running operation in Convex function
   - Root Cause: Convex functions have 60s timeout limit
   - Solution: Break into smaller operations or use Convex actions for long-running tasks
   - Prevention: Use actions for external API calls, mutations for database operations

   **ERROR-006: Type Mismatch in Convex Schema**
   - Category: Convex
   - Severity: Medium
   - Error: `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'`
   - Context: Inserting data that doesn't match schema
   - Root Cause: Schema definition doesn't match data structure
   - Solution: Update schema in `convex/schema.ts` or fix data structure
   - Prevention: Define schema first, validate data before insertion

   **ERROR-007: Missing Environment Variables**
   - Category: Build
   - Severity: High
   - Error: `CONVEX_URL is not defined`
   - Context: Running frontend without Convex configuration
   - Root Cause: Environment variables not set
   - Solution: Run `npx convex dev` to generate `.env.local` with CONVEX_URL
   - Prevention: Always run `convex dev` before starting frontend

   **ERROR-008: Circular Dependency in Convex Functions**
   - Category: Convex
   - Severity: Medium
   - Error: `Circular dependency detected`
   - Context: Convex function A imports function B which imports A
   - Root Cause: Poor module organization
   - Solution: Extract shared logic to separate utility file
   - Prevention: Keep functions independent, use shared utilities

5. **Migration-Specific Issues** - Common patterns during Encore ‚Üí Convex:
   - **Issue**: Dynamic SQL query construction
     - **Problem**: Encore allows dynamic SQL, Convex doesn't
     - **Solution**: Use Convex's filter/map methods instead
   - **Issue**: Encore secrets vs Convex environment variables
     - **Problem**: Different secret management systems
     - **Solution**: Migrate secrets to Convex dashboard environment variables
   - **Issue**: Encore's `getAuthData()` vs Convex's `ctx.auth`
     - **Problem**: Different auth patterns
     - **Solution**: Replace `getAuthData<AuthData>()` with `await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`

6. **Debugging Checklist** - Steps to diagnose unknown errors:
   1. Check Convex dashboard logs for detailed error messages
   2. Verify schema matches data structure
   3. Confirm auth is properly configured
   4. Check environment variables are set
   5. Review recent code changes
   6. Search this knowledge base for similar errors
   7. Check Convex documentation
   8. Check MCP reference repositories

7. **Quick Reference: Error Codes**
   - **401 Unauthorized**: Auth not configured or token invalid
   - **403 Forbidden**: User lacks required role/permissions
   - **404 Not Found**: Document doesn't exist in Convex table
   - **409 Conflict**: Booking overlap or constraint violation
   - **500 Internal Error**: Unhandled exception in Convex function
   - **Timeout**: Function exceeded 60s limit

   - **Migration Map**:
     - `backend/auth/auth.ts` ‚Üí `convex/auth.ts`
     - `backend/auth/me.ts` ‚Üí `convex/users.ts` (getMe query)
     - Encore `authHandler` ‚Üí BetterAuth + Convex auth middleware
   - **Key Patterns**:
     - Encore: `const auth = getAuthData<AuthData>()!;`
     - Convex: `const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity(); if (!identity) throw new Error('Unauthorized');`
   - **Success Criteria**: Auth working, users can login, role checks enforced
   - **Next Phase**: Phase 5 - Migrate Database Schema

7. **Phase 5: Migrate Database Schema to Convex**
   - **Objective**: Convert PostgreSQL schema to Convex document schema
   - **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
     1. Review `backend/db/migrations/1_initial_schema.up.sql` and `2_extended_schema.up.sql`
     2. For each PostgreSQL table, create Convex table definition in `convex/schema.ts`
     3. Convert SQL types to Convex validators (e.g., `TEXT` ‚Üí `v.string()`, `INTEGER` ‚Üí `v.number()`)
     4. Add indexes for performance (orgId, status, timestamps)
     5. Document schema decisions in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
     6. Tables to migrate: leads, ships, services, pricing_rules, quotes, bookings, threads, thread_messages, files, settings, audit_logs, ai_providers, ai_usage
   - **Conversion Patterns**:
     - SQL `CHECK` constraints ‚Üí Convex `v.union()` for enums
     - SQL `FOREIGN KEY` ‚Üí Convex document references (store ID as string)
     - SQL `JSONB` ‚Üí Convex `v.object()` or `v.any()`
     - SQL `TIMESTAMP` ‚Üí Convex `v.number()` (Unix timestamp)
   - **Example Conversion**:
     ```sql
     -- PostgreSQL
     CREATE TABLE leads (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('new', 'contacted', 'qualified'))
     );
     ```
     ```typescript
     // Convex
     leads: defineTable({
       name: v.string(),
       status: v.union(v.literal('new'), v.literal('contacted'), v.literal('qualified'))
     }).index('by_status', ['status'])
     ```
   - **Success Criteria**: All 13 tables defined in `convex/schema.ts`, indexes added

    - **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
      1. Install Convex React package: `npm install convex` (in frontend directory)
      2. Create `ConvexProvider` in `frontend/App.tsx`
      3. Replace `frontend/client.ts` (Encore client) with Convex client
      4. Update all components to use Convex hooks:
         - Replace Encore API calls with `useQuery()` and `useMutation()` from `convex/react`
      5. Components to update:

      7. Test all views
      8. Document in `MIGRATION_LOG.md`
    - **Pattern Example**:
      ```typescript
      // Before (Encore)
      import Client from './client';
      const leads = await Client.crm.getLeads();
      
      // After (Convex)
      import { useQuery } from 'convex/react';
      import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api';
      const leads = useQuery(api.leads.getLeads);
      ```
    - **Success Criteria**: All components updated, frontend working with Convex backend
