## üîÑ CACHING RULES

### Session-Level Caching

- **Cache expires after 24 hours automatically**
- **Each technology component has separate cache**

### Cache Validation
- **YOU MUST check cache timestamp before using cached material**
- **YOU MUST refresh cache if older than 24 hours**
- **YOU MUST document which cached material informed your decisions**

## üõ†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Any Task:
1. **READ THIS POLICY FIRST** - Mandatory
2. **IDENTIFY COMPONENT TYPE** - Frontend, Backend, Auth, etc.
3. **USE MCP TO STUDY REFERENCE** - Call appropriate gitmcp.io repository
4. **ANALYZE PATTERNS** - Extract best practices and patterns
5. **CACHE FINDINGS** - Store in session cache
6. **MAP TO TASK** - Apply patterns to your specific requirements
7. **DOCUMENT DECISIONS** - Reference which patterns informed your approach

### During Development:
- **YOU MUST reference studied patterns in your code comments**
- **YOU MUST follow the architectural patterns from reference repositories**
- **YOU MUST document deviations from reference patterns with justification**
- **YOU MUST update cache if new patterns are discovered**

## üìä COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Documentation:
- **Reference repository used**: gitmcp.io URL

- **Cache timestamp**: When material was cached
- **Application notes**: How patterns were applied to your code

### Quality Gates:
- **All reference patterns must be studied before implementation**
- **Code must follow reference repository architectural patterns**
